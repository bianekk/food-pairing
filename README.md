## Comparison of traditional and deep learning approaches in food pairing task

Food pairing, being one of the key topics in food science, is attracting attention from the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The subjective nature of flavor makes it challenging to develop new pairings that will go well together in recipes. This thesis addresses these issues through a chemical-based approach, describing foods by their molecule composition. A data analysis was conducted utilizing data from several datasets, which included dimensionality reduction, clustering and network analysis. This analysis discovered interesting underlying patterns in the data, uncovering certain relationships between groups (e.g. a close relation between cheeses and fine alcohols). Furthermore, four distinct methods were applied in the food pairing task, with the aim of identifying the most appropriate ingredients to match the given targets. The pairings identified were evaluated both by their appearances in a recipe database as well as through qualitative analysis. While the majority of the pairings identified were confirmed to appear in recipes, the methods also discovered novel pairings, indicating the potential of chemical data in food science. The research conducted offers a novel perspective on the task of food pairing, emphasizing the significance of the chemical composition of foods in future research.
